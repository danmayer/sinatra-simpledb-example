This is an example app trying to show the most simple and basic example of how to work with Amazon's SimpleDB
with Sinatra. It isn't a good example of Sinatra code or approaches. In fact please don't built Sinatra apps that
use get requests to build and delete objects! This is just the simplest thing I could put together that shows how to interact with
SDB from Sinatra, please contact dan <at> mayerdan.com if you have any issues or questions.

I will try to keep this example up to date so that it works with http://github.com/danmayer/dm-adapter-simpledb
